# Connect Four

Connect Four is a classic two-player game in which players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical board. The first player to get four of their discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

This implementation of Connect Four was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

- Players take turns dropping their colored discs into the board by clicking on the top row of the board.
- The game continues until one player gets four of their colored discs in a row or until the board is full.
- If one player gets four in a row, they win the game.
- If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a tie.
